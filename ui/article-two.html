        <b>DeepMind</b> Technologies Limited is a British artificial intelligence company founded in September 2010. It was acquired by Google in 2014. The company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing Machine, or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine, resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain.

The company made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional<b> Go </b> player for the first time.
